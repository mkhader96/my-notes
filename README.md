## Introduction:
Hello everyone,
I am Mohammad Adnan Khader. I live in Amman, Jordan.

My operating system is **Windows 10 Version 10.0.19043 Build 19043**

## Summary:
**The article is talking about fundementals of a good programmer. Here are some thoughts of mine regarding the article:**

* There will always be one goal for all programmers to understand and work towards and that would be that the code or software he writes should be for a certain purpose to make life easier for people.

* One of the main qualities of good programmers should be patience as it helps them in achieving their goals; for example patience can lead to better udnerstanding of the task required and patience leads to better problem solving skills.

* Another quality of good programmers should be simplicity, complicating their works is not helping. Simplicity leads to better understanding of the code and makes the code easier to maintain and update. Also simplicity leads to better consistency with the work done.

* One of the most important qualities to have is trying to achieve the required code with the easiest to read and simple code. More lines do not mean a better code. When the programmer is doing the job step by step and not complicating tasks; the productivity will increase and any updates to the code will be much easier in the futuer. 

* Lastly, programmers should be trying to work smarter not harder. Automation of some tasks can help reduce the work load by alot and the programmer can focus on other things in the tasks. Documentation and comments on the code can also make it easier to adjust and change the code faster in the future.
